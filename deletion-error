Error: deleting Resource Group "genaifunction-rg": the Resource Group still contains Resources.
│
│ Terraform is configured to check for Resources within the Resource Group when deleting the Resource Group - and
│ raise an error if nested Resources still exist to avoid unintentionally deleting these Resources.
│
│ Terraform has detected that the following Resources still exist within the Resource Group:
│
│ * `/subscriptions/08b45153-8a8b-4480-88e4-0c0406cdee1b/resourceGroups/genaifunction-rg/providers/microsoft.alertsmanagement/smartDetectorAlertRules/Failure Anomalies - genaifunction-ai`
│
│ This feature is intended to avoid the unintentional destruction of nested Resources provisioned through some
│ other means (for example, an ARM Template Deployment) - as such you must either remove these Resources, or
│ disable this behaviour using the feature flag `prevent_deletion_if_contains_resources` within the `features`
│ block when configuring the Provider, for example:

│ When that feature flag is set, Terraform will skip checking for any Resources within the Resource Group and
